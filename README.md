## Our Why

Many local produce markets and small, family-owned businesses lack the technical infrastructure to maintain an online presence. As a result, customers often have no way of knowing what products are currently in stock unless they physically visit the store or call ahead. This lack of visibility leads to missed sales opportunities, excess food waste from unsold inventory, and barriers to customer convenience. That is where Thyme Crate steps in.

## Our Solution

Thyme Crate is a web application designed to give small vendors a modern, digital storefront without requiring them to build or manage their own website. Our system displays real-time inventory pulled from a backend database, allowing customers to:

 
	•	View stock levels and product details from local markets
 
	•	Add items to a digital cart
 
	•	Reserve items for in-person pickup
 
  
This streamlined shopping experience bridges the gap between local markets and modern consumer habits, increasing customer engagement and reducing waste from unsold stock.
