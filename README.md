## Our Why

Many local produce markets and small, family-owned businesses lack the technical infrastructure to maintain an online presence. As a result, customers often have no way of knowing what products are currently in stock unless they physically visit the store or call ahead. This lack of visibility leads to missed sales opportunities, excess food waste from unsold inventory, and barriers to customer convenience. That is where Thyme Crate steps in.

## Our Solution

Thyme Crate is a web application designed to give small vendors a modern, digital storefront without requiring them to build or manage their own website. Our system displays real-time inventory pulled from a backend database, allowing customers to:

 
	•	View stock levels and product details from local markets
 
	•	Add items to a digital cart
 
	•	Reserve items for in-person pickup
 
  
This streamlined shopping experience bridges the gap between local markets and modern consumer habits, increasing customer engagement and reducing waste from unsold stock.

## Installation Instructions

To run the Thyme Crate app locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/code-differently/25q1-team1.git

2. **Navigate into the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd 25q1-team1

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install

4. **Set up environment variables:**

   Create a .env.local file in the root of the project and add your Firebase configuration:

   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=AIzaSyBQW_bjEj66-xJlyQXSGdyiTCX9BjRmVbU
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=market-manager-25q1.firebaseapp.com
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=market-manager-25q1
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=market-manager-25q1.firebasestorage.app
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=576540605678
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=1:576540605678:web:5fb22f902873bed11cc7ff
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-BDP41MXZE4

   Replace each value above with your actual Firebase project credentials.

5. **Run the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev

6. **Open the app in your browser:**
